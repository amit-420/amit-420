### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am a 1st year Masters student of Cybernetics and Robotics at CVUT, Prague

Aspiring Robotics Engineer
<!--
I am looking forward to creating something unique with an amalgamation of Robotics and a mining background.

My research interests lie in control theory and its diverse applications. I am particularly drawn to the algorithmic challenges inherent in optimal control, and I am keen to develop efficient and robust implementations of these algorithms.
